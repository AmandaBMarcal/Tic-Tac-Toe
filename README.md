# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Implemented game mechanics in JS creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game giving you the ability to choose either X or O.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

In this game we creeated our boces using html & cc where we classes out "box" choices as well as giving them individual id's. Variables were globally declared for the counter we used to make sure our even and odd values were assigned either an X and O. An event listener was added to each box in the gameSheet.

## Optimizations

This code was initially written in vanilla JS but I intend on transferring this information to Object Oriented Programming to practice writing in different ways.
